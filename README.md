# Next-words-Prediction
Predict next word LSTM(Natural language processing) has been an area of research and used widely in different applications. 
Deep learning models are excellent at learning complexity and patterns in sequential data. This makes Models suitable for challenging situations that require predicting the next word. 
If we give examples of these models; can successfully identify context and make precise predictions using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variations such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
